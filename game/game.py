#gameword is the random word that the computer chooses from the lists as the word that can be changed or colored

#ALGORITHM
# 1. Ask user for the guess input word
# 2. If input word is same as game word then print something and exit
# 3. If input word is not same as game word then apply character match logic
# 4. If number of tries are less than the guessCount then repeat from step 1
# 5. Print something if the user doesn't guess the word.
